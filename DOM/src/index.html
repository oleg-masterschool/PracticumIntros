            <p class="text__paragraph">There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New Hampshire.
                As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to
                the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
            <p class="text__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some
                extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
                from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof
                boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing
                through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>
            <p class="text__paragraph">Average cost: $100-150.</p>
